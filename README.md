# AutoHotKey Notification Setup

## Overview

This AutoHotKey script is designed to provide users with a notification mechanism. It allows users to customize the target address of the application they want to monitor for notifications. By default, the script is set to a placeholder target address, and users are required to modify it according to their specific needs.

   **it can be anything that has a local address**

3. Replace `" C:\Users\kiran\Downloads"` with the actual target address of the application on your system.
